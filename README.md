Build a project in Studio that manipulates data using dictionary variables and integers.

Calculate and print the number of victories of each 'Tour de France' winner 

Given a dictionary containing a year and associated name as input:

Calculate the number of victories of each winner.
Print every winner's name with its corresponding number of victories in the output panel.  
Note: Initialize a dictionary of type (Int32, String) with the following value â€” New Dictionary(Of Int32,String) From {{2006,"Oscar Pereiro"},{2007,"Alberto Contador"}, {2008, "Carlos Sastre"}, {2009,"Alberto Contador"}, {2010, "Andy Schleck"}, {2011, "Cadel Evans"}, {2012,"Bradley Wiggins"}, {2013,"Chris Froome"}, {2014,"Vincenzo Nibali"},{2015,"Chris Froome"},{2016,"Chris Froome"},{2017,"Chris Froome"}, {2018,"Geraint Thomas"}}.

Output: Nine entries in the Output panel containing every winner's name with its corresponding number of victories.

A few important things to consider:

Initialize a dictionary of type (Int32, String) with the value which was given at the start of the exercise and another one with (String, Int32).
Loop through the winners and count the number of victories.   
Loop through the second dictionary and print the output for the winners with more victories versus those with one victory.
